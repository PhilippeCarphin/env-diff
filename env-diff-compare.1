.SH NAME
env\-diff\-compare \- Display the differences between two environments
in human readable form
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.EX
env\-diff\-compare [options] BEFORE AFTER
.EE
.SH DESCRIPTION
Display the difference between two envrionments saved with
\f[CR]env\-diff\-save\f[R].
.SH CONFIGURATION
See CONFIGURATION section of \f[CR]env\-diff \-\-help\f[R].
.SH OPTIONS
Note: Options must come before \f[CR]CMD\f[R]
.SS \f[CR]\-\-list\-diff\f[R]
For \[aq]colon list\[aq] variables, they will be compared using set
comparison which ignores doubles, order, and empty elements (caused by
leading colon, trailing colon, or two consecutive colons).
.SS \f[CR]\-\-show\-function\-bodies\f[R]
For added functions, show the entire body of the function.
.PP
For modified functions, show an inline diff (like \f[CR]git diff\f[R])
between the initial and final versions of the function.
.PP
The function\[aq]s code is obtained using the \f[CR]type\f[R] bash
builtin.
It may have minor differences between the actual code in the file where
the function is defined.
.SS \f[CR]\-\-no\-ignore\f[R]
Disables the ignoring of changes to certain special variables.
.PP
Some variables are special and change no matter what like
\f[CR]BASHPID\f[R] (running \f[CR]CMD\f[R] and saving the final state
happens in a subshell where \f[CR]BASHPID\f[R] will be different).
.SS \f[CR]\-\-keep\-tmpdir\f[R]
Do not delete the temporary directory used to save states before and
after \f[CR]CMD\f[R].
These directories can rise to 10M in size if there are a lot of shell
functions.
Each function must be saved in its own file to garantee no parsing
errors.
Although the file may be smaller it has to take one block (usually 4k)
on disc.
.SS \f[CR]\-F CONFIG_FILE\f[R]
Specify an alternate config file.
.SS \f[CR]\-\-help\f[R]
Display this manpage and exit
.SH CAVEATS
Due to limitations in how \f[CR]env\-diff\-save\f[R] can save traps as
described in the CAVEATS section of \f[CR]env\-diff \-\-help\f[R].
.SH SPECIAL VARIABLES
See \f[CR]env\-diff \-\-help\f[R].
For code generation special variables cannot be configured.
.SH DEPENDENCIES
.IP \[bu] 2
jq
.IP \[bu] 2
standard UNIX tools (sort, comm, cut, cat, mkdir, mktemp)
.IP \[bu] 2
python3
.PP
Optionally if the python package \f[CR]pygments\f[R] is available, it
will be used to hightlight the body of new shell functions.
.PP
The python package \f[CR]pyyaml\f[R]
(\f[CR]python3 \-m pip install [\-\-user] pyyaml\f[R]) must be installed
to read the config file \f[CR]\[ti]/.config/env\-diff.yml\f[R].
