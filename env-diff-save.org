#+TITLE: env-diff-save

* NAME

env-diff-save - Save a complete shell environment

* SYNOPSIS

#+begin_src shell
env-diff-save DIR
#+end_src

* DESCRIPTION

Save a complete shell environment to directory for use by =env-diff-compare=,
=env-diff-gencode= or =env-diff-load=.

* CONFIGURATION

There is no configuration.  Absolutely everything about the environment is
saved.  Configuration only affects how differences are displayed by
=env-diff-compare=.

* CAVEATS

See CAVEATS section of =env-diff --help= which explains that some traps
cannot be reliably saved.

* DEPENDENCIES

- jq
- standard UNIX tools (sort, comm, cut, cat, mkdir, mktemp)
- python3

Optionally if the python package =pygments= is available, it will be used to
hightlight the body of new shell functions.

The python package =pyyaml= (=python3 -m pip install [--user] pyyaml=) must be
installed to read the config file =~/.config/env-diff.yml=.
